\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I am writing in my capacity of PhD supervisor to Mr.\ Henry Wilde.  I
have known Henry for over a 3 years having taught him in various courses during 
his undergraduate degree at Cardiff University.

Henry is at the early stage of his PhD but is already showing great promise.
I strongly believe he will not only become a strong member of the
European Operational Research community but also a fantastic mathematician in
his own right.

His research expertise is in the area of machine learning, statistical
modelling, stochastic modelling and game theory. In particular his research aims
to better understand costs and effectiveness of healthcare provision on a large
scale.

Henry is already proving to be a strong programming and inventive researcher.
His early work is already showing promise with novel classification methods
through the implementation of a surprising application of game theory.

It is with no hesitation what so ever that I recommend Henry to you. He
will benefit greatly from attending NATCOR.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
