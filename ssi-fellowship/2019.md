Application
-----------

Your main application is a voiceover of a slide presentation screencast and
reviewers will base the bulk of their decision on it. You will be measured on
presentation style, content and your plans. Keeping to time is very important
(you have 6 minutes only, if your screencast is any longer it will be trimmed to
6 minutes before sending to reviewers)

1. Who you are professionally (1min 30 sec suggest)
2. What you do (1min 30 sec suggest)
3. Your plans for Fellowship (3 mins suggested)

Here is a [guide](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/2019/application-video-guide)

*Application screencast URL:* Must be online until 1 March 2019

*Example of writing:* Links to no more than three examples.
E.g. blog post, scientific article, white paper, project report, etc. written by
you.

*Collaboration with other Fellows/Applicants:* If your plan is a succession of
existing Fellows activities or aligns with another application to this round of
Fellowship, can you add the persons name and a short description of how your
work aligns. You should ideally discuss this with the other person or people
before putting in an application. The Institute is very interested in supporting
work that build upon previous work in a strategic area and helps nurture and
grow communities of practice. This section is optional and all applications are
assessed on their own merit and we are looking to support novel work and new
areas also.

related) main picture of yourself that you are happy to be published on the web
