\maketitle

When we wish to compare the performance of two similar algorithms against one
another, it is difficult to discern why one may outperform the other with the
same data. In this project we will use Python to mimic the natural selection
process; constructing parts of a genetic algorithm that takes two algorithms and
generates populations of artificial datasets for which one algorithm outperforms
the other. The hope is then to discover what makes these datasets better-suited
for our preferred algorithm through data visualisation and analysis, while also
taking some time to analyse the genetic algorithm itself.
