Learning algorithm quality through evolution

Abstract
========

This poster presents a novel method - which has already been published - known
as Evolutionary Dataset Optimisation. The method allows for richer understanding
of how algorithms perform by exploring the space where preferable datasets exist
for a particular algorithm (as opposed to the classic paradigm of benchmark
comparisons).

The poster provides an overview of the method's mechanics and a case study in
clustering. This case study demonstrates some nuances of the method and verifies
a number of known properties about preferable datasets for two well-known
clustering algorithms.
